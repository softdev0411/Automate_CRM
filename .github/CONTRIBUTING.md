## Issues

We'd appreciate if you prefer posting issues on weekdays rather than weekends.

When reporting a possible bug, please provide detail steps so that we will be able
to reproduce the issue. Please try not to use phrases like "very big bug",
"huge issue", etc. No need to use exclamation marks as well.

Note that we don't provide developer help or any kind of support on GitHub.
For this, please use our [forum](https://forum.espocrm.com).
